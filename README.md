# Analysis of Zebrafish Behavior in Semi-Closed Loop Experiments with Groups of Dots
This repository contains code for analyzing zebrafish behavior during semi-closed loop experiments with moving-dot visual stimuli.
It includes code for extracting, transforming, and aligning fish tracking data with stimulus information to study behavioral responses to dot groups varying in size and motion.

Documentation is provided to describe the experiment design and the structure of the fish position, stimuli trajectory, and ROI files used in these analyses.

For a detailed explanation of the experiment and data structure, see [experiment_data_overview.md](experiment_data_overview.md).
